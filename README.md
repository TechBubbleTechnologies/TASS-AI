tassAI is computer vision software that is able to communicate autonomously with applications and devices via the Internet of Things. Our commercial version of tassAI powers a number of our Internet Of Things projects such as retailAI, but an open source version is also available for developers to use with the IoT JumpWay Developer Program.

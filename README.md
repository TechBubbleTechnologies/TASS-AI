# Open Source TASS AI Projects

![Open Source TASS AI Projects](images/tass-ai.png)

tassAI is computer vision software that is able to communicate autonomously with applications and devices via the Internet of Things. There are several versions of TASS and several different projects that evolved from the concept. Each version of TASS uses different techniques and technologies to accomplish facial recognition and other computer vision uses.

This repository provides the history of the open source TASS projects. Each tutorial provides full instructions and source codes.

## TASS Movidius Classifiers

The **TASS Movidius Classifiers** are computer vision programs using a number of different models including **Inception V3**, **Yolo**, **dlib**, **OpenCV** and **Facenet**.

## TASS Movidius Facenet Classifier

The **TASS Movidius Facenet Classifier** uses Siamese Neural Networks and Triplet Loss to classify known and unknown faces. The project uses an UP2 the Intel Movidius and the [iotJumpWay](https://www.iotJumpWay.tech "iotJumpWay") for IoT connectivity.

## TASS Movidius Inception V3 Classifier

The **TASS Movidius Inception V3 Classifier** uses a pretrained or custom trained **Inception V3** model and an **Intel® Movidius** to carry out object and **facial classification**, both locally and on a live webcam stream. TASS Movidius uses the [iotJumpWay](https://www.iotJumpWay.tech "iotJumpWay") for IoT communication and publishes messages to the broker when an object/face is identified.

## TASS Movidius Yolo Classifier

The **TASS Movidius Yolo Classifier** uses a pretrained **Yolo model** and an **Intel® Movidius** to carry out object, both locally and on a live webcam stream. TASS Movidius uses the [iotJumpWay](https://www.iotJumpWay.tech "iotJumpWay") for IoT communication and publishes messages to the broker when an object is identified.

[![Intel® AI DevCloud TASS Trainer](https://github.com/iotJumpway/IoT-JumpWay-Intel-Examples/raw/master/Intel-AI-DevCloud/images/tass-trainer.jpg)](https://github.com/iotJumpWay/IoT-JumpWay-Intel-Examples/tree/master/Intel-AI-DevCloud/Tass-Trainer)

## Intel® AI DevCloud TASS Trainer

This was the fourth version of TASS to be open sourced. The AI DevCloud TASS Trainer replicates the transfer learning side of the original program and is trained on the Intel  AI DevCloud HPC Cluster (Colfax Cluster). You can use this trainer for many of the computer vision examples you will find in this and related repos.

## Intel® Computer Vision SDK Windows Examples

This was the third version of TASS to be open sourced. The tutorial helps you build a Computer Vision security system on Windows using Intel® Computer Vision SDK, an Intel® Realsense camera/web/ip cam and an Intel® Edison connected to the Internet of Things via TechBubble Technologies iotJumpWay.

## OpenFace TASS Computer Vision Example

This was the second version of TASS to be open sourced. The tutorial uses the iotJumpWay Python MQTT Library for communication, an Intel® NUC DE3815TYKE or any Linux Desktop running Ubuntu, 1 or more IP Cameras, an optional Realsense camera, and our own deep learning neural network based on the popular OpenFace facial recognition toolkit.

## Facial Recognition & Identification on Raspberry Pi

This was the first version of TASS to be open sourced and became quite popular on Hackster.io. The tutorial helps you to build a Raspberry Pi that allows you to train a Haarcascades model, detect recognized/unknown people, optionally monitor the camera in near real-time via a stream, and communicate with the iotJumpWay sending sensor and warning messages that will allow your device to autonomously communicate with other IoT devices on your iotJumpWay network.
